Run all tests for the project — backend (Jest) and frontend (Vitest).

Steps:
1. Run `cd /Users/faryz/Desktop/Codes/project_fibula/backend && npm test` and capture the result
2. Run `cd /Users/faryz/Desktop/Codes/project_fibula/frontend && npm test` and capture the result
3. Report a clear summary:
   - How many backend tests passed / failed
   - How many frontend tests passed / failed
   - Overall status: ALL PASS or FAILURES FOUND
   - If any tests failed, list which ones and the error message
