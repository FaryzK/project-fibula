There are 5 classes of nodes, and each class has a different usage. This document covers the service node - document folder.

Trigger node
Example: manual upload

Pure execution node
Example: transform JSON, evaluate expression

Config node
Example: define system prompt once and reuse

Service node
Example: reconciliation dashboard showing matched documents, extractor node, data mapper

Webhook node (mainly used for sending events when something happens)

HTTP node (mainly used for exporting data)

DOCUMENT FOLDER NODE (Canvas)

The document folder node is a service node that acts as a holding area for documents within a workflow. Documents that arrive at the node are held and do not automatically proceed to the next node. A user must manually release them.

This is useful for cases requiring human review or manual gating before documents continue — for example, documents with missing or unexpected data, fallback cases from a SWITCH node, or any point where a user wants to inspect and approve documents before they move forward.

Node Configuration
When placing a document folder node on the canvas, the user selects a folder instance from a dropdown. One folder instance can be used by multiple nodes across multiple workflows, allowing documents from different workflows to be consolidated into one place.

Node Panel (clicking the node on canvas)
- Shows the selected folder instance (dropdown to change)
- Shows the input document and its metadata
- Shows the list of documents currently held in the folder (with their metadata)
- Shows the output document and metadata (after send-out)
- A Send Out button to release held documents to the next node

The node visually displays the count of held documents on the canvas.

Processing
When a document passes through the node during workflow execution, it is held in the folder. The document does not proceed until the user manually sends it out. The hold is stored with the document's source context: which workflow it came from, which node it arrived at, and when it arrived.

DOCUMENT FOLDER SERVICE

The Document Folders tab on the landing page lists all folder instances created by the user. Each row shows:
- The folder name
- The number of documents currently held in it
- The list of workflows and nodes currently using this folder instance — clicking a workflow + node entry navigates to that node on the workflow canvas

Creating a Folder
Users press "+ Add Folder", provide a folder name, and press Create. The folder instance is then available to select when configuring a document folder node on any workflow canvas.

Viewing Held Documents
Clicking a folder instance opens the document list for that folder. Each row shows:
- Document name
- The workflow it came from
- The node within that workflow where it is sitting
- Timestamp of when it arrived

Sending Documents Out
The user can select one or more documents and press "Send Out". This releases the selected documents to the next node in their respective workflows, continuing execution from where each document was held.

DOCUMENT FOLDER NODE IN THE WORKFLOW

The document folder node is the recommended destination for:
- The fallback output port of a SWITCH node (documents that matched no case)
- The false branch of an IF node
- Any point in the workflow where documents require human review before continuing
