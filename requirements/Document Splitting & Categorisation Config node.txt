There are 5 classes of nodes, and each class has a different usage. This document covers config nodes — Document Splitting and Document Categorisation.

Trigger node
Example: manual upload

Pure execution node
Example: transform JSON, evaluate expression

Config node
Example: define system prompt once and reuse

Service node
Example: reconciliation dashboard showing matched documents, extractor node, data mapper

Webhook node (mainly used for sending events when something happens)

HTTP node (mainly used for exporting data)

CONFIG NODES OVERVIEW

Config nodes require setup on a dedicated landing page tab before they can be used in a workflow. Once set up, they are selected via a dropdown when configuring the node on the canvas. The same config can be reused across multiple nodes and multiple workflows.

DOCUMENT SPLITTING

Purpose
The document splitting node takes a multi-page document as input, splits it into sub-documents based on a user-defined instruction, and outputs each sub-document as an independent document item. Each sub-document then continues through the workflow independently.

Naming Convention
Each split sub-document is named using the pattern: `parent_p{start_page}_{end_page}` (e.g. `parent_p1_5` for pages 1–5). The sub-document's metadata also stores the `parent_document_id` so the originating document can be traced.

Processing
When the node runs, the system sends the input document, the configured splitting instruction, and a system prompt to a VLM. The VLM returns a list of page number ranges. The system uses these ranges to split the document and outputs each segment as a separate document.

Setup (Document Splitting Tab)
On the landing page, the Document Splitting tab lists all splitting instructions created by the user. Each entry shows the instruction name and a truncated version of the instruction text.

To create a new instruction, the user presses "Add new splitting instruction" and is navigated to a form where they define:
- Instruction name (e.g. "Split into invoices and POs")
- Splitting instruction text (e.g. "Split the document into individual invoices" or "Split the document into its invoice, PO, and delivery note sections")

Once created, the instruction is available in the workflow canvas dropdown.

Editing and Usage
Clicking an instruction in the list opens the edit page. This page also shows which workflows and nodes are currently using this instruction — clicking an entry navigates directly to that node on the canvas.

Deletion
A splitting instruction can only be deleted when no canvas nodes are using it. The usage list helps the user identify and migrate any remaining nodes before deleting.

Canvas Node
When a document splitting node is placed on the canvas and opened, the user selects a splitting instruction from a dropdown. If none exist, a link is provided to create one. Once a splitting instruction is selected, the node is ready to use.

DOCUMENT CATEGORISATION

Purpose
The document categorisation node takes a document as input, classifies it into one of the configured categories using an LLM, and attaches the resulting category label to the document's metadata as output. The document itself is unchanged — only the metadata label is added.

Processing
When the node runs, the system sends the document, the configured categorisation labels and their descriptions to an LLM. The LLM returns a category label. That label is written into the document's metadata and the document flows to the next node.

Setup (Document Categorisation Tab)
On the landing page, the Document Categorisation tab lists all categorisation instructions created by the user.

To create a new instruction, the user presses "Add categorisation instruction" and is navigated to a form where they define:
- Instruction name
- One or more categorisation labels, each with a label name and a description

Example:
- Label: INVOICE — Description: "A document that contains an invoice number only"
- Label: PO — Description: "A document that contains both an invoice number and a PO number"

Up to 20 labels can be defined per instruction.

Editing and Usage
Clicking an instruction opens the edit page, where the name, labels, and descriptions can be updated. The edit page also shows which workflows and nodes are currently using this instruction — clicking an entry navigates directly to that node on the canvas.

Canvas Node
When a document categorisation node is placed on the canvas and opened, the user selects a categorisation instruction from a dropdown. Once selected, the node is ready to use.
